1. Requirements
-----------------
ViennaCL requires the following:
 * A recent C++ compiler (e.g. gcc 4.x.x)
 * For accessing GPUs and multi-core CPUs: OpenCL (shared library and include files)
 * For building some of the tutorials: uBLAS (shipped with the Boost libraries)


2. Installation
-----------------

The first step is to extract the file:

Unix-based OS:
$> gunzip ViennaCL-1.4.1.tar.gz
$> tar -xf ViennaCL-1.4.1.tar
$> cd ViennaCL-1.4.1

Windows:
Extract the file using your favorite compressor/decompressor, e.g. 7-zip.

ViennaCL is a header-only library, therefore it is sufficient to copy the subfolder viennacl/ (holding the header files) into you project directory or your system include directory. For instructions on how to set the include paths correctly, please refer to the documentation of your compiler.

For building the examples, proceed as follows:

Unix-based clients:
 * change to the build directory:
   $> cd build

 * call cmake
   $> cmake ..

 * If CMake cannot find the OpenCL files, e.g. 'Could NOT find OPENCL (missing:  OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR)', please set the paths manually, e.g.
   $> cmake -DOPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR=../CL ..
   Or, use the CMake GUI.
   $> cmake-gui
   Or, disable openCL if you are not planning to use parallel programming components
   $> cmake .. -DENABLE_OPENCL=0
 
 * Use 'make' to build all examples:
   $> make
   (alternatively, you can build them individually via 'make blas1', 'make viennacl-info', etc.

 * Start the tutorials (optional)
   $> examples/blas1
   $> examples/custom-kernels
   $> examples/viennacl-info
   (...)

Windows:
 * Open the CMake GUI
 * Set the source code location ('Where is the source code:') to the extracted ViennaCL-1.x.x folder
 * Set the build folder ('Where to build the binaries:') to the subfolder build/ in the ViennaCL-1.x.x folder.
 * Click on 'Configure' and select your Compiler
 * Click on 'Configure' again
 * Click on 'Generate'
 * Navigate to the build/ folder, open the generated project files with your favorite IDE, and build them.
